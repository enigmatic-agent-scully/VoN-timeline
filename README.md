## Voices of Note: A History of the Atlanta Gay Men's Chorus (AGMC) and the Atlanta Women's Chorus (AWC)

In 1981, a couragous group of singers formed the Atlanta Gay Men's Chorus, the very first gay men's chorus in the South and one of the world's longest running gay choruses.

Since 1981, the organization has evolved into Voices of Note, the non-profit organization that manages both the AGMC and the Atlanta Women's Chorus, which began in 2013 as the Atlanta Women's Project, a small ensemble sponsored by the AGMC that has since grown into its own independent choral ensemble under the organizational umbrella of Voices of Note.
